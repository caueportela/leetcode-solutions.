# 61. Rotate List 



# Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by k places.

Example 1:

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3] 

Example 2:

Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 500].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
0 <= k <= 2 * 109 



Test cases:

Test 1: 

Input: head = [1,7,4,2,1], k = 2 
Output: [2,1,1,7,4] 
 
Test 2:
Input: head = [0], k = 2 
Output: [0]  
 
Test 3:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 300
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
